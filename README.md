# Wine_Quality_Prediction
This project aims to develop an analytical classification model to predict the quality of the red variant of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” style of wine. The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The classification model will provide insights into the quality of the wine by predicting whether it is good (1) or bad (0).
